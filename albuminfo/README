ALBUMINFO VERSION 0.2

Albuminfo is a gmusicbrowser plugin for retrieving album-relevant information (such as reviews) from
allmusic.com (AMG).

It has only been tested with versions 1.1.7 and 1.1.8 of gmusicbrowser.


INSTALLATION

Copy albuminfo.pm to ~/.config/gmusicbrowser/plugins (create the folder if it doesn't exist) or the
plugins folder in your installation (for example /usr/share/gmusicbrowser/plugins).

Restart gmusicbrowser.


USAGE

Enable the plugin in Preferences -> Plugins. The plugin creates a new tab in the "Context"
widget. Album info is downloaded for the playing song. The context pane also supports groups (as
defined in the layout file).

The plugin must search AMG before it can download the album info. If it fetches the wrong album, the
user can search AMG manually by clicking the "Manual search" button. 

The "Refresh" button makes a new, automatic AMG search, meaning that the plugin will pick the album
(and ignore any albums the user have chosen with a manual search).


OPTIONS

"Auto-save positive finds" means saving the album info whenever an album's AMG page is found (even
if there is no review on the page). The review file is overwritten without confirmation on every
positive hit.

"Auto-save fields" means saving AMG info about Genres, Moods, Styles or Themes for all the songs in
the album. NOTE: GENRES IS THE ONLY FIELD EXISTING AND ENABLED IN GMUSICBROWSER BY DEFAULT. "Moods", 
"Styles" and "Themes" exists, but must be enabled. This can be done under Preferences -> Fields -> 
Standard fields -> mood/style/theme.
